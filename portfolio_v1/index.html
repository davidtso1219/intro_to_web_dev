            Hello there! My name is Hao-Ting Tso, and I go by David. I am really new to the world of computer science.
            I started learning it when I first took a class at my community college, Foothill College. (Foothill for the win!)
            I was really intrigued about programming at first, but I did not have a chance to start learning web development
            seriously. I hope I can use this website to record my journey as becoming a real software engineer and motivate
            myself.
        </p>

                    I was a full-time summer intern at SLAC for 10 weeks. My job is mostly assisting my professor to finish her paper about
                    Gamma Ray Burst. To be more specific, my job is to use some program to transform as much manual work to automatic work as possible.

                    I was an active member there and attended many useful workshops and learned a few mind-blowing
                    knowledge of the technology such as cryptography and the Internet.
